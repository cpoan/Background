## Preparing histograms

For joint fit,  
you need to prepare histograms of **time since last muon(dtlSH)**,  
their are **3 catogories** of muon which classified by muon.    
Each muon catogory should have a dtlSH histogram,  
but we further slice the histogram by **N_slices = 5** for example.  
This slicing is based on certain IBD quantity,  
and we have **4 IBD quantities** Ep, Ed, dT, dist.
